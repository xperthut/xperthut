                                <p>
                                    Every step in life is important. It is hard to predict where you will go but your current step will reaches you towards the goal.
                                </p>
                                <p>I grew up in a family where education, patience, mutual respect and hard work were treated as the main assets to being a good human. As well as the right way to achieve success in life . My parents as teachers propelled my self growth encouraging my dreams and individuality. I thank them for the great start in life and feel pride in being their son. My wife and kids also bring the love and joy into my life that teaches me further about family and meaning. </p>
                                <p>Community service as well as helping in Feed the Hungry programs, non profits, and local environmental clean ups and beautification that enriches my locality, gives me joy and humility. For social balance and physical health I enjoy the following: tennis, fishing, hiking, soccer, cricket, golf, travel, concerts, and boating.</p>

                                    Now I live in Pullman, WA, USA. I like this 
                                    place very much because it is quiet and full of green. People of this territory are gentle, polite and affable.

                                                        Brain is an amazing part of every living creature. It controls the actions as well as emotions. 
                                                        Family is everything for me. It is the very first place to train our brain using customs, values and manners.
                                                        Over the time, we adjust our non-linear learning curve based on surrounding knowledge. I love all the institutions 
                                                        from where I get chance to acquire knowledge. I also love those individuals who help me to get through.

                                                        I have completed my Ph.D. from <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/" style="color: wheat; text-decoration: none;">Washington State University</a>, USA in August, 2020. I inaugurated 
                                                        here at <i>Fall, 2015</i>. My reseach focused on subgraph mining and visual analytics. During my research, I developed an exploratory data 
                                                        analysis tool named <a href='https://xperthut.github.io/HYPPO-X' style="color: wheat; text-decoration: none;"><strong>HYPPO&ndash;X</strong></a> that explore the high order structure of data in a form of graph. 
                                                        This graph is a topological representation of the data. I also developed algorithms on structural graph properties (path and flare) to identify divergent subpopulation besides resilient subpopulation.

                                                        after a very tough and competitive examination. I admitted in <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/" style="color: wheat; text-decoration: none;">BUET</a> in Computer Science and Engineering department in March 2004.
                                                        I completed my graduation (B.Sc.) in March 2009.

                                                        Each year nearly 2000 students get admitted after a very competitive examination. 
                                                        According to historical statistics, each student of this institution is very successful in his professional life.

                                                        The study technique of teachers of this institution is very interactive. 
                                                        The innovative teaching styles of teachers attracted me a lot. 
                                                        My most favorite teachers are Jaharlal Sarkar Sir and Nimai Chandra Dey Sir. 
                                                        Both of these Mathematicians helped me to understand mathematics in a very different angle.
                                                        The teacher named Mizanur Rahman is a marvelous teacher in Biology. I learned a lot about biology, science and general life.
                                                        Sushanto sir explained the physics in such a way that we could visualize the physical interaction and relation of objects.

                                                        started here. I spend my early 9 years here. Lots of memory and events are surrounded with this institute. This is the first institution where 
                                                        we made more closer friendship with classmates that remains throughout the life.

                                                        fantastic teachers. Their moral values and customs are very influential to follow. Their strictness and zero tolerance on bad manners helped us to

I along with my family is passing through a pandemic which is caused by a virus of corona group named COVID-19. The number 19 refers the first occurrence year which is 2019. The whole world is captured by this virus and it already kills few hundreds of thousands life. It affects the world economy so badly that people of all sectors are already suffering, even though government is continuously providing financial support but it is really hard to provide proper support for a single government. Due to the downgrading of business, the job market started collapsing in different domains which badly impacts on my early career after graduation.

I joined as an Applied scientist Intern in the field of Machine Learning. All the team members along with my Manager and Mentor were very open minded and friendly. We had lots of fun besides works, for instance, boat picnic, weekly happy hour, etc. Everyone here are so obsessed about to make happy to their customer. I really like and enjoy the concept.

                                                        Bangladesh, United Kingdom and New Zealand. I worked in Bangladesh branch from 2010 to 2015. This company provides eTicketing solutions

                                                        As an software developer, I developed many websites from stretch. Beside that, I also worked on ASP, OO Javascript, AJAX, and 
                                                        MSSql server. I have experience to develop complex query language.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Besides as a software developer, I also worked as a team lead for a specific section of the development team of 6 persons.

                                                    <p>   
                                                        I served as a general manager to take care of all aspects of Bangladesh branch from 2013&ndash;2015. During this 
                                                        period, I experienced a lot of managerial issues those I never faced as a software developer. I worked with higher authority as well as local authorities (e.g. energy department, water supply department, local leaders and political parties, etc) that helped me to gain multi&nbsp;disciplinary knowledge.
